# Deep-Super-Resolution-Research
This repository contains all the work done , observations noted and models worked upon during my internship at [Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar](https://www.iitgn.ac.in/) under [Dr. Ravi S. Hegde](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aHWM-b8AAAAJ&hl=en). My Research focus was on Image SuperResolution using Deep Learning. Most of my work involved exploring existing solutions and analysing and study their approach. The work was concluded with a Progressive Upsacalling methods using RDNSR with VGG Perceptual Loss for generating high resolution images. The Progressive upscalling can upscale to very high resolution given the RDNSR base network.

* Most of my scripts follow a common pattern and can be understood from these repositories.

* The networks given here were worked on 3 Nvidia GTX 1070s with data parallelism in Keras multi gpu mode for training.  
* Some of the folder may contain observational notes. These were noted during training.  
* The Deep Prior network is not adhering to the original paper. I though of creating residual connections between encoder and decoder network layers thinking it would work out well. It did but only for noise reduction purpose. Also I did not realise this was a U-net architecture.
